//** HX711 library configuration:
//** Number of samples and some filtering settings can be adjusted in the HX711_ADC.h library file
//** The best RATE setting is usually "LOW" 10SPS, see HX711 data sheet (RATE is selected by HX711 pin 15, this can be set by a solder jumper on some HX711 modules)
//** RATE "HIGH" 80SPS will also work, but conversions will be more noisy, so consider increasing number of samples in HX711_ADC.h
